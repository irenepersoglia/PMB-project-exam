The aim of the project was the study of regulatory relationships between cell lines and their tissues of origin. In particular, the study focuses on two cell lines (LCLs and primary fibroblast) and their two relative tissues of origin (blood and skin samples, respectively), and the goal is to compare the regulatory networks of the pairs.
